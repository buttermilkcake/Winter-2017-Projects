# Winter-2017-Projects
What I've been up to with coding and learning, Winter 2017.
I've been assessing holes in my learning and rectifying the situation. I have attended some Kansas City Women in Technology(KCWIT) events.
This is a great group and I plan on getting more involved with them. I'm also on the organizational team of the PythonKC meetup and will be 
doing a talk on Python (it's history, etc) at a joint KCWIT / PythonKC event this summer.

I took some classes thru Codecademy on the command line, Git and relational databases. I'm currently learning PostgreSQL, after much 
work on errors during the installation process! I'm also learning how to manipulate Excel spreadsheets with a Python program called 
Openpyxl. I want to use both of these latter tools where I currently work; Postgres to manage electronic records of archival material and
Openpyxl to make a large spreadsheet containing budgets operate more efficiently. I've also begun to dip my toe into Linux and learning how
to navigate that. I'm most familiar with Windows, but have some OS X experience as well. 

I want to keep honing my skills as a programmer/developer, getting better at the things I already know, learning new concepts and programs,
speaking to groups about my experiences, and trying to put more hours into my day!
